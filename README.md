## An R-package containing generic functions for analysis for the state of South Carolina.

`scutils` is an open-source R-package published as a repository on
GitHub. The package stores generic functions that are useful for a variety 
of other analyses. This website documents the scutils

DES). This package is currently being maintained by Nicholas Pinder, while
working as a Hydrologist at the State of South Carolina Department of 
Environmental Services. This information is intended for research and long-term water
